SOLID is an acronym for five important principles in object-oriented design that help create well-structured, flexible, and maintainable code. These principles are:

1 - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means each class should focus on a single functionality and avoid becoming cluttered with multiple unrelated tasks.

2 - **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to extend the functionality of your code without having to modify existing code.

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) itself isn't about a specific number of implementation methods. It's a design principle that guides how you approach implementing functionalities in your code.

Here's the core idea of OCP:

Open for Extension: Your code should be designed in a way that allows you to add new functionalities without modifying existing code.
Closed for Modification: Once a piece of code is working, you shouldn't need to change it to introduce new features.
There are several ways to achieve OCP in practice, and the best approach depends on your programming language and specific situation. Here are some common techniques:

- **Inheritance:** Subclasses can inherit behavior from a base class and add new functionalities without modifying the base class itself.
- **Interfaces:** Define interfaces that specify what functionalities a class must provide. Concrete classes can then implement these interfaces in different ways.
- **Dependency Injection:** Classes don't create their dependencies directly, but instead receive them through injection. This allows you to easily swap out dependencies with new ones that provide different functionalities.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Implement different algorithms or behaviors as separate classes, allowing you to choose the appropriate strategy at runtime.
The key takeaway is that OCP is a principle, not a specific method.  By following this principle, you can write more flexible and maintainable code that can easily adapt to changing requirements.



3 - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the program's correctness. In simpler terms, if you have a function that works with a certain type of object, it should also work with objects of any subtypes of that object, as long as they adhere to the base class's behavior.

4 - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Large interfaces with many methods can be cumbersome for classes that only need a few functionalities. This principle suggests breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

5 - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions can be interfaces or abstract classes. This principle promotes loose coupling between different parts of your code, making it easier to test and modify.

By following these SOLID principles, you can write cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to understand, modify, and extend in the future.
